TelepathicGrunt:
A huge thanks to TelepathicGrunt for his amazing work for structure mods. I used his TutorialMod
when I started developing this mod and have moved to using and modifying the RepurposedStructures
mod.

Changes:
Most changes will be listed at the top of each file, but some general changes are:
- Data. All the structures and other data have been replaced with my own.
- I have also simplified and removed many features that I do not need.
